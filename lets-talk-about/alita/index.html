        <h1>Alita: Manga vs. Movie</h1>
        <h2>Brief History</h2>
        <p>In Japan, the series is known as <em>Gunnm</em>. The kanji representation for it is 銃夢, meaning "gun dream." The series is authored by Yukito Kishiro (木城 ゆきと).</p>
        <h3><em>Battle Angel Alita</em></h3>
        <p>The original <em>Gunnm</em> series ran from 1990-1995. It is divided into chapters called <em>Fights</em>. The series was first published in the U.S. by Shonen Jump, who made a number of changes to various names, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gally → Alita</li>
            <li>Daisuke Ido → Dyson Ido</li>
            <li>Zalem → Tiphares</li>
            <li>Jeru → Ketheres</li>
            <li>Jasugun → Jashugan</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After Kishiro grew frustrated with Shonen Jump (during <em>Last Order</em>) and moved his series over to Kodansha Comics, the U.S. division republished the entire original series with all but the first of these changes reversed. This U.S. translation is available in a deluxe box set as well as standard paperback. Interestingly, the movie retains these changes for people but not for places.</p>
        <p>Those with old printings should keep in mind that anything after <em>Fight 51</em> has been retracted by the author and replaced with the <em>Last Order</em> series. This was due to his poor health, which he ended up recovering from. Realizing he would not die, he chose to retract the original <em>Gunnm</em> ending and replace it with a new series.</p>
        <h3><em>Battle Angel Alita: Last Order</em></h3>
        <p>The sequel to the original series, it ran from 2000-2014. It is divided into chapters called <em>Phases</em>. <em>Phases 1-93</em> were originally published by Shonen Jump, where the U.S. releases included their name changes from the original series. However, the author grew frustrated with the company during this time over translation particulars, and he ended up moving the property to Kodansha Comics. Despite the move, the name changes were retained by Kodansha in the United States. Kodansha also republished <em>Phases 1-93</em>, but retained Shonen Jump's name changes here as well.</p>
        <p>At the time of this writing, Kodansha has not republished the <em>Last Order</em> series with original names as they did with the original series.</p>
        <h3><em>Battle Angel Alita: Mars Chronicle</em></h3>
        <p>The third and current series in the franchise, it began its run in 2014 immediately after <em>Last Order</em>. This is said to be the final entry in the franchise.</p>
        <p>Kodansha Comics has been the one and only publisher of this series.</p>
        <h2>Versus the Movie</h2>

        <h2>Recap</h2>
        <h3>Battle Angel Alita</h3>
        <h4>First Arc</h4>
        <p>A cyber-physician named Daisuke Ido is wandering around the junk pile below Zalem looking for spare parts for his patients. He stumbles upon the core remains of a cyborg. He takes her to his clinic and examines her. He learns that she is still alive and revives her. The girl doesn't remember her name, or anything else about herself, so he names her Alita after his dead cat.</p>
        <p>While performing as a Hunter-Warrior, Ido begins to collect the cyber body parts of his bounties to give to Alita. Curious about where he's been going each night, Alita follows him into an alley. Mistaking him as a simple murderer, she tries to stop him and says that it's not worth killing people just to restore her body. Alita learns that Ido is really a Hunter-Warrior.</p>
        <p>Later, Alita decides that she can become a Hunter-Warrior herself, so she goes to Factory 33 to apply. She then crosses paths with a massive cyborg named Makaku (known in the movie as Grewishka). She is no match for him, and he shreds her body into pieces with one swipe of his hand while she is mid-air. Landing on a single hand, Alita then flips into the air and drives her remaining arm into his right eye. Ido then shows up and damages Makaku enough for them to escape. Ido is severely injured, but manages to rescue Alita and return to the clinic.</p>
        <p>Back at the clinic, Ido has Alita equipped with a Berserker body he had found earlier in a ship which had crashed into a ravine. As Ido is severely injured, Gonzu must perform the procedure. Alita later wakes and finds the body to be an amazing fit for her.</p>
        <p>Once acclimated to her new body, Alita and Ido head to the Kansas Bar to recruit help for going after Makaku. A Hunter-Warrior named Zapan is extremely arrogant towards this idea, and messes with Alita, causing her to easily handle him and the rest of the bar. Makaku does make an appearance, however, where Alita and himself then fight in the under-levels below the bar. Here, Alita eventually kills him.</p>
        <h4>Second Arc</h4>
        <p>Some time later, Alita wakes up to find a mysterious boy standing over her. His name is Yugo and he wants to know if she's okay. They soon discover the bodies of the ones who caused Alita to lose consciousness. She is surprised to see Yugo steal their spinal columns, which are not replacable with synthetics. Alita is not impressed by this behavior. It is then revealed that Yugo not only steals spinal columns from corpses, but also from those who are still living.</p>
