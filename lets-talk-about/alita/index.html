        <h1>Alita: Manga vs. Movie</h1>
        <h2>Brief History</h2>
        <p>In Japan, the series is known as <em>Gunnm</em>. The kanji representation for it is 銃夢, meaning "gun dream." The series is authored by Yukito Kishiro (木城 ゆきと).</p>
        <h3><em>Battle Angel Alita</em></h3>
        <p>The original <em>Gunnm</em> series ran from 1990-1995. It is divided into chapters called <em>Fights</em>. The series was first published in the U.S. by Shonen Jump, who made a number of changes to various names, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gally → Alita</li>
            <li>Daisuke Ido → Dyson Ido</li>
            <li>Zalem → Tiphares</li>
            <li>Jeru → Ketheres</li>
            <li>Jasugun → Jashugan</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After Kishiro grew frustrated with Shonen Jump (during <em>Last Order</em>) and moved his series over to Kodansha Comics, the U.S. division republished the entire original series with all but the first of these changes reversed. This U.S. translation is available in a deluxe box set as well as standard paperback. Interestingly, the movie retains these changes for people but not for places.</p>
        <p>Those with old printings should keep in mind that anything after <em>Fight 51</em> has been retracted by the author and replaced with the <em>Last Order</em> series. This was due to his poor health, which he ended up recovering from. Realizing he would not die, he chose to retract the original <em>Gunnm</em> ending and replace it with a new series.</p>
        <h3><em>Battle Angel Alita: Last Order</em></h3>
        <p>The sequel to the original series, it ran from 2000-2014. It is divided into chapters called <em>Phases</em>. <em>Phases 1-93</em> were originally published by Shonen Jump, where the U.S. releases included their name changes from the original series. However, the author grew frustrated with the company during this time over translation particulars, and he ended up moving the property to Kodansha Comics. Despite the move, the name changes were retained by Kodansha in the United States. Kodansha also republished <em>Phases 1-93</em>, but retained Shonen Jump's name changes here as well.</p>
        <p>At the time of this writing, Kodansha has not republished the <em>Last Order</em> series with original names as they did with the original series.</p>
        <h3><em>Battle Angel Alita: Mars Chronicle</em></h3>
        <p>The third and current series in the franchise, it began its run in 2014 immediately after <em>Last Order</em>. This is said to be the final entry in the franchise.</p>
        <p>Kodansha Comics has been the one and only publisher of this series.</p>
        <h2>Versus the Movie</h2>
